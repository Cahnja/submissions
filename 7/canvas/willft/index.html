    <p>Distance is measured as .03 meters per pixel. Time, which starts at 1 second per second can be moved backwards and forwards, though making time negative will not perfectly rewind what just happened. Negative time is just something cool to play with. Spawn a random velocity ball by clicking somewhere. Shake it up if things get boring!</p>
