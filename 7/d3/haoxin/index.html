    <p>Doesn't really work yet. This is suppose to be a chart that shows which type of resturants got what percentage of grade A,B,and C that were assigned by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Each bar represents 100% but the sum of the elements don't add up for some reason. I wanted to make hover text for each element, but didn't get to.
