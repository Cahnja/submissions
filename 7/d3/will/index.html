    <h1>Bustime</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>Enter a bus line (i.e. M86) to graph realtime data on active buses. Each circle is a bus. The x is latitude, measured from the minimum latitude to the maximum latitude, with the y being longitude, measured similarly. Radius is distance to next stop. A transparent circle represents a bus that is making "noProgress" according to the bustime API (this may include a bus in a layover). Though the demo updates every 31 seconds, the server typically updates its feed from the MTA every minute (so as to respect the MTA's rules).</p>
